## About The Project

Creator : Apuroop Pendurthi

Description : Basically,we deploy a simple FastAPI application to AWS Lambda. First we build a FastAPI app and create simple tests. We then go ahead to create a GitHub workflow to ultimately deploy to AWS Lambda. We finish off by configuring AWS API Gateway to access the FastAPI application.

## Built With

Tools Used : Python, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, VS Code, Github

* []()

## Getting Started

Instructions to run Project.


### Prerequisites

1-) Install any code editor (preferably VS Code ).
2-) Create a python virtual Environment and install all the modules existing in requirements.txt file.
3-) Create a simple API Code which is available in main.py
4-) Test the test_core.py code using pytest 
5-) Once done, Build a github Pipeline using the code in main.yml (this is in yaml format)
6-) Have an AWS account, login into it and create an s3 bucket and AWS lambda function in same region, the Lambda function must have runtime in Python 3.7
7-) Change handler name of Lambda function to main.handler to make sure it works fine.
8-) Add additional aws yaml code into main.yml and push all to github to commit. Now a zip file is generated which can be now deployed in AWS Lambda.
9-) Now setup, AWS Access key, access key ID and Default Region in Secrets menu of Github to allow Github to perform actions in AWS Account.
10-) Now, create an API Gateway and once an endpoint is generated, you can use Postman to check the working of the endpoint, basically the endpoint represents the output which we coded in main.py file
11-) So, FastAPI is deployed in AWS lambda and an endpoint is created using AWS API Gateway with Github Actions.

## Usage

Any type of API can be created with this process and AWS lambda which is a serverless function can be used to make this process faster and endpoints can be generated.
